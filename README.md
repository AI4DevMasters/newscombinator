## Introduction

Reading a lot of news-sites is tiring. Being top-informed on Reddit, Ycombinator, Makernews, Datatau, Coinspotting and many more has become a hassle. The Newscombinator combines all those sites and grabs it from a publicy available API.

The Newscombinator is written in JavaScript, wrapping AngularJS and Bootstrap around a RESTful API. It is a sample App to demonstrate the possibilities of the underlying Solr-Index.

## Installation


    git clone git@github.com:tomw1808/newscombinator.git 


Then install it

    npm install
    
    bower install


And start hacking your own version. As simple as that.

The solution here is responsive, pretty much standard angular and bootstrap. Feel free to make it really awesome.


## Api Limits

We (well, technicall I) try our (my) best to keep the service running. Currently there are soft-limits in place: if you take the server(s) down - accidentally or not - your IP will be banned, no exceptions. So keep it sane, please. 

## License

Feel free to redistribute, modify and use the code for and in any projects. I will not take any responsibility or whatsoever for code/server and or information provided, and keep the right to change/modify/stop the underlying API at any time. You can find more in the provided LICENSE.txt. You can take it for granted, I will not pursue any copyright claims to the software, either modified or not. I personally think its good manner to get in touch with me before using the software for third party apps or anything else.
