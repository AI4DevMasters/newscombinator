# Newscombinator

> A Webapp is just a frontend around a database


## Introduction

Reading a lot of news-sites is tiring. Being top-informed on Reddit, Ycombinator, Makernews, Datatau, Coinspotting has become a hassle. The newscombinator combines all those sites and grabs it from a publicy available API.

The Newscombinator is written in JavaScript, wrapping AngularJS and Bootstrap around a RESTful API. It is a sample App to demonstrate the possibilities of the underlying Solr-Index.

## Installation


    git clone git@github.com:tomw1808/newscombinator.git 


Then install it

    npm install
    
    bower install


And start hacking your own solution.


## Api Limits

We (well, technicall I) try our (my) best to keep the service running. Currently there are soft-limits in place: if you take the server(s) down - accidentally or not - your IP will be banned, no exceptions. So keep it sane, please.
